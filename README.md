## Project Structure

### Architecture

This app follows the principles of ``Clean Architecture`` ([Example repository from mahdinazmi](https://github.com/mahdinazmi/Flutter-News-App-Clean-Architecture/tree/main)). The codebase is organized into distinct layers, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

### State Management

This app uses the ``BloC (Business Logic Component)`` pattern for state management. BloC helps to organize and manage the flow of data in a reactive and scalable way.

### Unit Testing

The codebase is thoroughly tested using ``mockito``. To ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's functionalities. To run the tests, follow the instructions in the [Testing Section](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking) below.
